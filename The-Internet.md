# The internet
*The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.*
## How does the internet work?
*The Internet simply moves data from one place to another, so that we can chat, browse and share. Data moves over the Internet in a manner called “packet switching.” What packet switching basically does is send your data in separate pieces – each tagged with your intended destination.*

## What is HTTP?
*HTTP is the `TCP/IP` based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.*

## Browsers and how they work?
*A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface.*

> Step-by-Step Working of Browser

- You enter a URL in the web browser.
- The browser finds the IP address for the domain using DNS.
- The browser initiates a connection with the server.
- Next, it sends an HTTP request to the webserver.
- The server handles the request and sends out an HTTP response.
- The browser renders and displays the HTML content, i.e., the web page.

> Common Terms Around Browsers

- URL : Universal Resource Locator is the address of a given unique resource on the Web.
- HTML : HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, used for creating web pages and applications.
- HTTP : HTTP is a protocol that allows the fetching of resources, like HTML documents. It is a client-server protocol, which means your web browser initiates requests.
- IP Address : It identifies the location of a specific server that’s connected to the internet. Each website has its own unique IP address and can have multiple IP addresses when hosted at multiple locations. For example, a common IP address for Facebook is 157.240.241.35.
- DNS : DNS or Domain Name System is the database that contains records of the domains. It helps discover websites using human-readable addresses.
- Cookies : Cookies are the small pieces of data websites store on your device’s storage.
- Domain Name : A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as ‘google.com’, and ‘facebook.com’. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system.
- Hosting : Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.

# Web Developer Tool : CMS (Content Management System)
***A content management system, often abbreviated as CMS, is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.***

***In simpler language, a content management system is a tool that helps you build a website without needing to write all the code from scratch (or even know how to code at all).***

*Exemples: Wix, WordPress,...*

# Web Developer Tool : In-Browser Tool
***Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load.***

***Modern trends and webapps have dramatically changed the way web developers can build. Obviously you need some type of IDE to code new files and save them for deployment. But what about just testing your code snippets? There are more tools available now than ever before!***
***All of these apps require an Internet connection, and some of the more advanced editors offer pro plans to upgrade your account features. But most of these tools will surely come in handy when you’re scrambling to debug a block of JavaScript or PHP.***

# Web Developer Tool : Integrated Developement Environmemt (IDE)
***An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software. Developers use numerous tools throughout software code creation, building and testing. Development tools often include text editors, code libraries, compilers and test platforms.***
