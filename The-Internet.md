# The internet
*The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.*
## How does the internet work?
*The Internet simply moves data from one place to another, so that we can chat, browse and share. Data moves over the Internet in a manner called “packet switching.” What packet switching basically does is send your data in separate pieces – each tagged with your intended destination.*

## What is HTTP?
*HTTP is the `TCP/IP` based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.*

## Browsers and how they work?
*A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface.*

> Step-by-Step Working of Browser

- You enter a URL in the web browser.
- The browser finds the IP address for the domain using DNS.
- The browser initiates a connection with the server.
- Next, it sends an HTTP request to the webserver.
- The server handles the request and sends out an HTTP response.
- The browser renders and displays the HTML content, i.e., the web page.
