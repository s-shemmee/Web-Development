<h3>About this Dog</h3>

The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties and were named 'retriever' because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive lover of water and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards.
